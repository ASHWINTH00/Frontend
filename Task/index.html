        Kumaraswami Kamaraj, popularly known as K. Kamaraj, was a great Indian freedom fighter, politician, and statesman who played a significant role in the political and educational development of Tamil Nadu. He was born on July 15, 1903, in Virudhunagar, Tamil Nadu. Though he could not complete his formal education due to poverty, he grew up to become a visionary leader with deep concern for the poor and underprivileged.

Kamaraj actively participated in the Indian freedom movement, inspired by Mahatma Gandhi. He was imprisoned several times by the British for taking part in protests and movements. After independence, Kamaraj became the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu (then Madras State) in 1954. During his rule, he focused on development, especially in education, agriculture, and industrial growth. He introduced free and compulsory education and started the midday meal scheme, which helped increase school enrollment and reduce dropouts among poor children.

He was a very simple and honest leader who led by example. Despite holding high office, he lived a humble life without seeking personal gain. Kamaraj also played a crucial role in national politics and was called the “Kingmaker” for helping choose two Prime Ministers — Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi — after Nehru’s death.

K. Kamaraj was awarded the Bharat Ratna posthumously in 1976, India’s highest civilian award, in recognition of his service to the nation. His life and legacy continue to inspire generations of Indians.
